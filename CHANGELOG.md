## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Enable Tencent Cloud deployment when an enforce-mode desired-state document
  contains certificates with `deploy.enabled: true`.
- Apply the TLS probe timeout to the handshake as well as the TCP dial.
- Verify every resolved probe address so a partially updated backend cannot
  hide behind a healthy node.
